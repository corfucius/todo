php todo app project 

This is a project with which I am challenging myself in an effort to learn more about php, oop and mvc. The focus is on learning how to move my functions, queries etc over to the classes, creating cleaner more reusable, secure code.  The basic functionality was built-in first, and I will be revisiting the code to refactor as time goes on.
